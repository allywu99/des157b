    <h3>User Journeys</h3>

    <p>From our user testing, we learned that our interface was pretty clear! Users liked the interactive elements and that it was easy for them to navigate. They also appreciated the progression of events and showing the perspectives of peers and Susan.</p>

    <h3>Paper Prototypes</h3>

    <p>The feedback that we received was to make the website available in a mobile version because people scan QR codes with their phone. Since this is a learning platform, we have to figure out other ways that we could market our website. Ultimately, our interface is looking great, but we need to figure out more details about our user journeys.</p>
