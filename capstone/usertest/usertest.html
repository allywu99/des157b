    <h3>Satomi</h3>
   <ol>
       <li>How easy was it for you to navigate through the quiz app?</li>
       <p>The hierarchy was solid, which helped the user know what was important and what wasn't. Maybe if the instructions popped up first, then we wouldn't have to sacrifice the size of the font. Maybe have it be opened by an information icon.</p>
       <li>Did you find the instructions provided clear and concise?</li>
       <p>The instructions were a little small, which made understanding the interface a little more difficult.</p>
       <li>Were the answer options easy to read and understand?</li>
       <p>The user did not struggle with the answer options.</p>
       <li>How satisfied were you with the visual design and layout of the quiz app?</li>
       <p>Add captions to the images to give the user some context.</p>
       <li>Were the feedback or result screens informative and helpful?</li>
       <p>The figma file actually helped the user visualize what we were aiming for, which they appreciated, but we just have to work on implementing the code.</p>
   </ol>


   <h3>Rachel</h3>
      <p> - INSTRUCTIONS TOO SMALL, Overlay text is hella small, can make overlay space much better, Link paragraphs to Susan’s website to provide more context of her quotes, Extend home page images into a larger overlay that explains what’s going on, Provide a way that the user can find resources more connected
       </p>
  
   <h3>Subhan and Vishnu</h3>
   <p>- Layout is appreciated, home page, Colors matched UC Davis colors, which the user appreciated, Overlay small, again!, Questions actually prompted Davis students to think </p>
