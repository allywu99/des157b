    <title>Allyson's Capstone Project Proposal</title>

    <h1>DES157B Capstone Project Proposal</h1>
    <h2>Allyson Wu & Daniel Ramos</h2>

    <h3>What is your topic and who is the target audience?</h3>
    <p><b>Topic:</b> We would like to combine two topics into our final project: the first topic being a hi-res digital version of the seal where users can hover over different panels and learn more about the history and background of that panel, and the second topic capturing modern renditions of the seal in real time in Davis.
    <br><br> <b>Target audience:</b> Local Davis residents / Incoming UC Davis students </p>

    <h3>Do you plan to work with a partner? If so, who?</h3>
    <p>Allyson Wu and Daniel Ramos will be working on this project</p>

    <h3>What are some of the features you imagine your project/product would include?</h3>
    <p>We plan on using scroll interactions that are valid in mobile and desktop interfaces. These scroll interactions will guide the user through stories of Davis’ history and compare the seal’s panels with present representations of the content within the seal.
    
    <br> Video testimonials will be sprinkled throughout the project, or contained within a testimonial section. Additionally, touchpoints will be added where hovering over the high-resolution image of the seal will reveal background history.</p>

    <h3>Are there possible tangents, challenges, concerns, or vague ideas related to your ideas?</h3>
    <p>We plan on making this site an “infinite scroll” interaction page with parallax effects and elements fading in and out on screen. Some possible concerns with this idea are the timing and pacing of the animations as well as accessibility issues regarding scrolling. We’re also unsure right now of how we’d want to display the modern rendition of the seal — it can either be in the form of illustrations, hi-res photos of current Davis, or even video testimonials of current residents and how they feel about different topics of the seal. Another concern we have is how accurately we can collect background information about the seal. We’ll likely be scheduling multiple interviews with Susan Shelton as well as other community partners to extract the most accurate and thorough information we can to put on our site. Overall, we’re really excited to start digging deeper into the seal and can’t wait to bring this project to life!</p>
